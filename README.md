## About

The Enchiridion Library is a Java-based Multi-User Dungeon and Interactive Fiction Engine accessible
through a Telnet connection.

#### Purpose

The purpose is to create a single online library filled with various interactive stories and games
that can be accessed from any device capable of establishing a telnet connection. The HUB will serve
as the gateway to the stories as well as a portal for authentication and cloud storage of saved game
states. In order to act as a library the hub will also allow for the uploading of stories.

#### Plans

Once in a usable and stable state the hub will be launched on a public server and will be accessible
through telnet on port 1127.

## Getting Started

#### Running Locally

The application can be run locally using a single gradle command. The gradle wrapper is included
with the repository, so gradle does not need to be installed in order to execute the command.

```
$ ./gradlew clean run
```

This will initiate the spring boot application on your local machine and will serve the library out
of port 1127 over telnet.

#### Running with Docker

You must have docker installed and running in order to perform the following commands.

```
$ ./scripts/build.sh
$ ./scripts/run.sh
```

Once this is done, the Golem docker container will be running and serving the Telnet Server for
the Golem MUD/IF Hub out of port 1127. Don't forget to kill (and optionally remove) the container
once you are finished.

#### Connecting to the Hub

Assuming you are running the server on your local machine (or local docker) you can use
the following command to connect to the server. Otherwise, simply change 'localhost' below to the
IP address or hostname of the server on which the hub is running.

```
$ telnet localhost 1127
```

This will connect you to the Enchiridion Library where you can log in and start playing stories.
